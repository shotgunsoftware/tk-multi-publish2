Publish Items
=============

Publish items are the individual UI elements displayed to the user for
publishing. These items are created during the collection phase of the
publisher. Items can be displayed in a flat list for example when a collection
of unrelated files are dragged and dropped into the publisher. Alternatively,
items can be displayed in a hierarchy when it is important to show some
relationship between them.
