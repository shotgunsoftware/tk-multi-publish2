class BasicFilePublishPlugin(HookBaseClass):
    """
    Plugin for creating generic publishes in Shotgun.

    This plugin is typically configured to act upon files that are dragged and
    dropped into the publisher UI. It can also be used as a base class for
    other file-based publish plugins as it contains standard operations for
    validating and registering publishes with Shotgun.

    Once attached to a publish item, the plugin will key off of properties that
    drive how the item is published.

    The ``path`` property, set on the item, is the only required property as it
    informs the plugin where the file to publish lives on disk.

    The following properties can be set on the item via the collector or by
    subclasses prior to calling methods on the base class::

        ``sequence_paths`` - If set in the item properties dictionary, implies
            the "path" property represents a sequence of files (typically using
            a frame identifier such as %04d). This property should be a list of
            files on disk matching the "path". If the ``work_template`` property
            is set, and corresponds to the listed frames, fields will be
            extracted and applied to the publish_template (if set) and copied to
            that publish location.

        ``work_template`` - If set in the item properties dictionary, this
            value is used to validate ``path`` and extract fields for further
            processing and contextual discovery. For example, if configured and
            a version key can be extracted, it will be used as the publish
            version to be registered in Shotgun.

    The following properties can also be set by a subclass of this plugin via
    :meth:`Item.properties` or :meth:`Item.local_properties`.

        publish_template - If set, used to determine where "path" should be
            copied prior to publishing. If not specified, "path" will be
            published in place.

        publish_type - If set, will be supplied to SG as the publish type when
            registering "path" as a new publish. If not set, will be determined
            via the plugin's "File Type" setting.

        publish_path - If set, will be supplied to SG as the publish path when
            registering the new publish. If not set, will be determined by the
            "published_file" property if available, falling back to publishing
            "path" in place.

        publish_name - If set, will be supplied to SG as the publish name when
            registering the new publish. If not available, will be determined
            by the "work_template" property if available, falling back to the
            ``path_info`` hook logic.

        publish_version - If set, will be supplied to SG as the publish version
            when registering the new publish. If not available, will be
            determined by the "work_template" property if available, falling
            back to the ``path_info`` hook logic.

        publish_dependencies - A list of files to include as dependencies when
            registering the publish. If the item's parent has been published,
            it's path will be appended to this list.

        publish_user - If set, will be supplied to SG as the publish user
            when registering the new publish. If not available, the publishing
            will fall back to the :meth:`tank.util.register_publish` logic.

        publish_fields - If set, will be passed to
            :meth:`tank.util.register_publish` as the ``sg_fields`` keyword
            argument. A dictionary of additional fields that should be used
            for the publish entity in Shotgun.

        publish_kwargs - If set, will be used to update the dictionary of kwargs
            passed to :meth:`tank.util.register_publish`. Because this
            dictionary updates the kwargs built from other ``property``
            and ``local_property`` values, any kwargs set in this property will
            supersede those values.

    NOTE: accessing these ``publish_*`` values on the item does not necessarily
    return the value used during publish execution. Use the corresponding
    ``get_publish_*`` methods which include fallback logic when no property is
    set. For example, if a ``work_template`` is used, the publish version and
    name might be extracted from the template fields in the fallback logic.

    This plugin will also set an ``sg_publish_data`` property on the item during
    the ``publish`` method which may be useful for child items.

        ``sg_publish_data`` - The dictionary of publish information returned
            from the tk-core register_publish method.

    NOTE: If you have multiple plugins acting on the same item, and you need to
    access or operate on the publish data, you can extract the
    ``sg_publish_data`` from the item after calling the base class ``publish``
    method in your plugin subclass.
