class PublishTree(object):
    """
    This class provides an interface for operating on a tree of items to be
    published. At a high level, the publish tree is structured like this:

    .. code-block:: text

        [root]
          [item] Item 1 (A Publish Item)
            [task] Publish to Shotgun
            [task] Upload Media
          [item] Item 2 (A Publish Item)
            [task] Publish to Shotgun
            [task] Upload Media
          [item] Item 3 (A Publish Item)
            [task] Publish to Shotgun
            [task] Upload Media
            [item] Item 4 (A Child Item)
              [task] Re-rez
              [task] Alternate Transcode

    The tree is composed of a hierarchy of items. Each item in the tree,
    excluding the root, can have associated tasks.

    Instances of this class are iterable, making traversal very easy:

    .. code-block:: python

        for item in publish_tree:
            # process the item...
            for task in item.tasks:
                # process the task

    The special, :py:attr:`~root_item` is exposed as a property on publish tree
    instances. The root item is not processed as part of the validation,
    publish, or finalize execution phases, but it can be used to house
    :py:attr:`~.api.PublishItem.properties` that are global to the publish tree
    itself. All top-level publish items have the :py:attr:`~root_item` as their
    parent and can store information there.

    For example, to collect a list of files to process after all publish tasks
    have completed (within the :meth:`~.base_hooks.PostPhaseHook.post_finalize`
    method of the :class:`~.base_hooks.PostPhaseHook`), you could do something
    like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        # in your publish plugin...

        def publish(self, settings, item):

            # do your publish...

            # remember the file to process later
            if item.parent.is_root:
                files = item.properties.setdefault("process_later", [])
                files.append(my_publish_file)

        # then, in your post_finalize...

        def post_finalize(publish_tree):

            # process files that were stored for later
            files = publish_tree.root_item.properties.get("process_later", [])

    The class also provides an interface for serialization and deserialization
    of tree instances. See the :meth:`~save_file` and
    :meth:`~load_file` methods.
