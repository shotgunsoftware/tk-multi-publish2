        Factory method for generating new items.

        The ``item_type`` is a string that represents the type of the item. This
        can be any string, but is typically defined by studio convention. This
        value is used by the publish plugins to identify which items to act
        upon.

        The basic Shotgun integrations, for example, use a hierarchical dot
        notation such as: ``file.image``, ``file.image.sequence``,
        ``file.movie``, and ``maya.session``.

        The current convention used within the shipped integrations is to
        classify files that exist on disk as ``file.{type}`` (``file.image`` or
        ``file.video`` for example). This classification is determined from the
        mimetype in the base collector. In addition, any sequence-based items
        are classified as ``file.{type}.sequence`` (``file.image.sequence`` for
        example).

        For items defined within a DCC-session that must be save or exported
        prior to publish, the shipped integrations use the form ``{dcc}.{type}``
        for the primary session item and ``{dcc}.{type}.{subtype}`` for items
        within the session.

        In Maya, for example, the primary session item would be of type
        ``maya.session`` and an item representing all geomtery in the session
        would be ``maya.session.geometry``.

        These are merely conventions used in the shipped integrations and can be
        altered to meet studio requirements. It is recommended to look at each
        of the publish plugins shipped with the publisher and housed in each of
        the toolkit engines to see what item types are supported by default.

        The ``display_type`` argument corresponds to the item type, but is used
        for display purposes only.

        Examples include: ``Image File``, ``Movie File``, and ``Maya Scene``.

        The ``name`` argument is the display name for the item instance. This
        can be the name of a file or a node name in Nuke or Houdini, or a
        combination of both. This value is displayed to the user and should make
        it easy for the user to identify what the item represents in terms of
        the current session or a file on disk.

        A dictionary-like object that houses item properties local to the

        This property behaves like the local storage in python's threading
        module, except here, the data is local to the current publish plugin.

        You can get and set values for this property using standard dictionary
        notation or via dot notation.

        Attempts to access this property outside of a publish plugin will raise
        an ``AttributeError``.

        It is important to consider when to set a value via
        :meth:`Item.properties`` and when to use :meth:`Item.local_properties`.
        Setting the values on ``item.properties`` is a way to globally share
        information between publish plugins. Values set via
        ``item.local_properties`` will only be applied during the execution of
        the current plugin (similar to python's ``threading.local`` storage).

        A common scenario to consider is when you have multiple publish plugins
        acting on the same item. You may, for example, want the ``publish_name``
        and ``publish_version`` to be shared by each plugin, while setting the
        remaining properties on each plugin instance since they will be specific
        to that plugin's output.

        Example::

            # set shared properties on the item (potentially in the collector or
            # the first publish plugin). these values will be available to all
            # publish plugins attached to the item.
